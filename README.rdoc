= Introduction

This is a wrapper for JACK[http://www.jackaudio.org].

Here's a quick code sample. Currently no docs.

  require 'jack'
  
  JACK::Client.new("myname") do |jack|
    port = jack.port_by_name("system:capture_1")
    port.connect("system:playback_1")
    sleep 5
    port.disconnect("system:playback_1")
  end
  

Please notice that code is rather alpha-version and can contain bugs.
